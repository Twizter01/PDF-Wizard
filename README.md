### B. Component Architecture

The application follows a modular component-based architecture:

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── FileUpload.tsx      # File handling and validation
│   ├── TextEditor.tsx      # Text editing and display
│   └── ExportPanel.tsx     # Export functionality
├── utils/
│   └── pdfProcessor.ts     # PDF processing utilities
├── types/
│   └── index.ts           # TypeScript type definitions
└── App.tsx                # Main application component
```

### C. Data Flow

1. **File Input**: Users upload PDF files via drag-and-drop or file selection
2. **Validation**: Files undergo format and size validation
3. **Processing**: PDF.js extracts text content with progress tracking
4. **Display**: Extracted text is rendered in an editable interface
5. **Export**: Users can download processed text in various formats

## III. Implementation Details

### A. PDF Processing Engine

The core text extraction functionality utilizes PDF.js with the following configuration:

```typescript
pdfjsLib.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = 
  `//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/${pdfjsLib.version}/pdf.worker.min.js`;
```

**Key Features:**
- Character-level text processing for maximum accuracy
- Preservation of document formatting and structure
- Support for Unicode and special characters
- Metadata extraction including author, title, and creation date

### B. Text Processing Algorithm

The text extraction process employs a sophisticated algorithm that:

1. **Analyzes spatial positioning** of text elements to preserve layout
2. **Processes character encoding** to handle special characters correctly
3. **Maintains line breaks and paragraph structure** based on positional data
4. **Combines text items** intelligently to reconstruct readable content

### C. Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling includes:
- File format validation
- Size limit enforcement (50MB maximum)
- Graceful degradation for corrupted PDFs
- User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
